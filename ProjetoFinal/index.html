                    It is 2022 and here we go again. A new African and Arab Collegiate Programming Championship season
                    is kicking off and a lot of surprises await everyone.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Amira, the ACPC Business Development Consultant, is checking with ACPC partners and friends how
                    they feel about the new season and the Kick Off contest by the following question: "On a scale from 1 to
                    10 how excited are you about the new season?". Amira knows her friends very well and one of them is
                    Obioma. Amira knows that if Obioma answered with any number larger than 5 then she is excited and
                    with any number other than that then she isnâ€™t excieted.

                </p>

                Given the number that Obioma answered the question with, can you tell us if she is excited or not?</p>
